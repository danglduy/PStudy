# Practices

These are practices generated by Claude

1. **FizzBuzz Challenge**: Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz".

2. **Palindrome Checker**: Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

3. **List Comprehension Practice**: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation**: Create a program that counts the frequency of words in a given text and stores the results in a dictionary.

5. **File I/O Exercise**: Write a program that reads a text file, counts the number of lines, words, and characters, and writes the results to a new file.

6. **Rectangle Class**: Create a Rectangle class with width and height attributes, and methods to calculate area, perimeter, and whether it's a square.

7. **Generator Function**: Write a generator function that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number.

8. **Error Handling**: Create a function that divides two numbers but handles potential errors (like division by zero) with appropriate try/except blocks.

9. **API Integration**: Write a program that fetches data from a public API (like weather data) and parses the JSON response to display specific information.

10. **Simple Web Scraper**: Create a script using the BeautifulSoup library to extract specific information from a webpage, like all headlines from a news site.

11. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number without using loops.

12. **Object-Oriented Banking**: Design a banking system with classes for Account, Customer, and Transaction that handles deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

13. **Binary Search Algorithm**: Implement a binary search function that efficiently finds an element in a sorted list.

14. **Decorator Pattern**: Write a decorator function that measures and prints the execution time of any function it decorates.

15. **Command Line Tool**: Create a command-line utility that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius with argument parsing.

16. **Data Structure Implementation**: Build your own implementation of a stack or queue data structure with appropriate methods.

17. **Sorting Algorithm**: Implement a sorting algorithm like merge sort or quick sort from scratch.

18. **Game Development**: Create a simple text-based game like Hangman or Rock-Paper-Scissors with a user interface in the terminal.

19. **Regular Expression Practice**: Write a function that validates email addresses, phone numbers, or passwords using regular expressions.

20. **Multithreading**: Create a program that uses multiple threads to perform concurrent operations, like processing items in a queue simultaneously.
